## Professional Experience

* 2016.4~now PingCAP, Inc.

Join the company early, and work there since then. I focus on the tidb database kernel development.<br>
With the reorganization of the company, I work with different teams and responsible for different modules of the database kernel, and also gain deep understanding about how the whole system works.<br>
Among the 'big' features, I write the initial partition table implementation.<br>
Contribute to tons of other trivial features, and be an active developer of all time.

* 2014.7~2016.4 Guangzhou Shunfei Information Technology Co., Ltd.

This is an internet advertising technology company which provides professional programmatic advertising solutions.
I work as a backend engineer there.

* 2013.4-2014.4 Doodle Mobile Ltd.

My first job in a game company, where I work as a software engineer and develop Android games.

## Projects

* TiDB

Top 1 contributor of the [tidb repository](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/graphs/contributors).

Contribute to almost all kinds of modules: parser, planner, executor, transaction, DDL etc.

* cora

I am also keen on the programming languages theory. [cora](https://github.com/tiancaiamao/cora) is the design and implementation of my own lisp dialect.<br>
Design a language requires a lot of skills like interpreters, compilers, VM designs, type inference, GC etc.

* A Deep Dive Into Go

An ebook I wrote many years ago. This book digs into implemention of the Go programming language and covers many Go internals.
Including but not limited to the assemble code, memory management, GC, goroutine scheduling etc.
Although it is based on Go 1.0/1.1 which is pretty outdated, much of idea behind are still applicable.<br>
This project receives 1.8k stars on [github](https://github.com/tiancaiamao/go-internals).
